Team Manager is an application where you can easily keep track of your team, its players and their individual stats. Start by signing in to add your team and the players on your team. Quickly update the team's win-loss record and your player's stats after each game to track the progress during the season. You may also view other teams, its players and their stats so you're able to build a strategy for your next game!
